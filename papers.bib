	abstract = {Social vulnerability and social capital have been shown to influence how severely communities are impacted by natural hazards and how quickly they recover. Indices exist to quantify these factors using publicly available data; however, more empirical research is needed to validate these indices and support their use in pre-disaster planning and decision making. Using data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and data gathered through imagery analysis in Google Earth, this study evaluates the effectiveness of two indices of social vulnerability and social capital to predict housing impacts and rates of recovery in Florida and Puerto Rico following Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017. We found the social vulnerability index to be statistically significant in explaining the variation of housing impacts in both case studies, with varying results for the sub-indices of social vulnerability. Results for the social capital index were mixed between the case studies, and we found no statistically significant relationship between any of the indices and rates of housing recovery. Our results show that indices such as these can be useful, with an awareness of limitations, for researchers and emergency practitioners, and additional empirical analysis is needed to more fully support their efficacy for resilience assessment.},

	abstract = {Existing flood risk management approaches rely heavily on assessments of damage to physical infrastructure components, but often fail to consider other impacts or effects of floods that are difficult to quantify monetarily such as impacts to mental health. For flood risk managers to comprehensively plan and prepare for future flood risk, there is a need to understand the factors that contribute to the incidence of these impacts. The purpose of this study is to identify the factors that contribute to adverse mental health impacts from floods through a systematic review of the relevant literature. We included studies that quantitatively assessed the incidence of anxiety, depression, PTSD, or psychological distress in individuals affected by flood events. We excluded qualitative studies, studies that analyzed hospital records or other health surveillance databases, and studies of hazards other than floods. We gathered literature by querying three citation index databases: Web of Science, MEDLINE, and Engineering Village. We performed full-text content analysis on 243 articles and identified 62 that met the inclusion criteria for our analysis. We performed a metasummary to extract findings from the studies and identified 36 risk factors for mental health impacts assessed across the studies. Factors related to individual's experiences during a flood event such as home damage or evacuation were more frequently found to be associated with mental health impacts whereas socioeconomic and demographic factors were more frequently found to not be statistically significant in models after adjusting for other variables. These findings suggest that future efforts to develop quantitative models to predict mental health risks from floods will require estimation of individual-level direct flood impacts and suggest a need for further research into the relationship between demographic factors and mental health impacts of floods.},
